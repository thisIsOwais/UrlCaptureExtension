//  * with that approach - hence we reverted, and now allowing only background script to talk over web socket:
//  *
//  *  We would have a content script injected into all the pages ==> we would have as many web_socket connections
//  * as we have tabs open
//  * 2. And sending message to background script is very trivial.  Its the background script which talks to
//  * web socket
